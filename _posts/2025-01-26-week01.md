title: "Week 1: What If I Defined Open Source Right Now"
---

I would like to make it clear: _I know very little about open source projects._ I probably wouldn't be able to tell an open source project from a closed source one unless I specifically knew it was open source.

If I heard this term today, I would think about a relatively small app (as opposed to titans like Instagram or VSCode), the source code to which is available to anyone either through GitHub or some platform. I'd also assume that a big focus for its developers is protection from malware and surveillance. Because users can view the source code to an open source app, an app that boasts spyware or viruses is unlikely to be used.

In addition, most open source projects I've encoutered have a DIY, "made in my garage" feel about them. They are **usually** small, fun and relatively simple. In other words, they target a small specific need of the users, building upon something that already exists, for example a browser or an operating system.
