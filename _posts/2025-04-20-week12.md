## Progress report

For Mattermost, I am still working on the issue that I was assigned two weeks ago. My fix was wrong, and I am still struggling to load the development environment (iOS app simulator). However, I am making progress by exploring the project’s structure on Jira and helping my teammate out with translations!

## Open source in business

For the *Open Source in Business* discussion, I watched a panel on consulting in the FOSS industry. The part that stuck out to me was the speakers’ input on sustainability in the world of open source. To me, sustainability has always meant leaving enough resources for future generations, which is a very broad and sort of diplomatic way to look at sustainability. At an industry level — particularly in the open source industry — it is in the best interest of *commercial* companies to keep their open-source counterparts sustainable, according to the panelists. I liked the examples such as Indeed making systematic payments to open source developers or companies making donations to open source projects based on their employees’ votes. It is very interesting that projects such as Mattermost are still going commercial but others aren’t even though they could. This devotion to staying open source and living off of donations (I can’t even say profiting, considering how complicated and vast some open source projects are) is fascinating to me.
